# Instructor Interview Assessment

As a part of the Tech Elevator instructor interview process, we would like for you to complete an assessment that we provide to our students. You should produce a solution that you feel demonstrates what would be considered a best practice and a suitable reference for junior developers.

The assessment is available as an ASP.NET MVC or Spring MVC application. You may choose either technology. Within the `dotnet` and `java` folders is a README with instructions. 

The scope of our MVC module covers the following concepts:

* Controllers and Views
* Razor/JSTL
* HTTP GET & HTTP POST
* Model binding
* Dependency Injection
* Session
* Validation
* Data Access Objects

Although indicated in the instructions, you do not need to time-box yourself to one hour. This is the amount of time allowed for students to complete the assessment.

**Please provide a markdown document that discusses any thoughts or assumptions you made when approaching your solution.**

## Submit Your Work

Please follow these steps to work on the assessment and submit your work.

To submit your work, create a [git bundle](http://schacon.github.io/git/git-bundle.html) of the entire repository using the command `git bundle create your-name-assessment.bundle --all`, and send the file to `josh@techelevator.com`.

After we receive your submission, we will review it and follow up with the next steps.
